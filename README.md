# Metacognition-and-Prediction-errors-

This project investigates if metacognitive sensitivity levels are higher for surprising visual events as opposed to predicted ones. 
It uses a tightly controlled perceptual decision making set up in order to test this hypothesis. Participants will see a cue in the form of an arrow eitehr pointing to the left or to the right followed by a random dot motion task with fixed coherence levels. The cue is predictive of the motion direction resulting in 75% of the cases in an expected visual outcome and in 25 % of the cases in an unexpected event / prediction error. 

The experiment was programmen in psychopy and the hierarchical bayesian model was fitted using matlab and Steph Fleming's h-meta-d tool box.
